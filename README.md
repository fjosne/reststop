Reststop - friction-free web development
==============================================

## About

Reststop is a thin layer built on top of the Java Servlet API. Reststopâ€™s module system lets you code independent
features in individual modules. During development, Reststop will track your code base, recompile and hot-deploy the
modules which changed.

The result is friction-free web development with robustness of the Java language and tool stack, but with the feedback
loop of a dynamic language.


## Getting Started

Add the following prefix to the Maven settings file (per-user: ~/.m2/settings.xml; global: $M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml):

        <pluginGroups>
          <pluginGroup>org.kantega.reststop</pluginGroup>
        </pluginGroups>


Create Reststop project:

        mvn reststop:create

Open a browser with the url [http://localhost:8080/helloworld/](http://localhost:8080/helloworld/)

This will show a page with the simple message:

        {"message":"Hello world"}

Now add som politeness to the return statement in plugins/helloworld/src/main/java/YOUR.PACKAGE.NAME/HelloworldResource.java:

        return new Hello(greeting + " dear world");

Then hit the reload button, and while you did that Reststop notified the change, recompiled and hot-deployed it:

        {"message":"Hello dear world"}

### Next Level

Try to change the word "world" into something different, and reload again:

        return new Hello(greeting + " dear friend");

Reststop just discovered that a Test failed, showing test code and stack trace. Now update the HelloworldResourceTest.java to match and reload again.

Next try to remove the following line in HelloworldResource.java:

        return new Hello(greeting + " dear friend");

Reststop now shows you an compilation error, with location and error message from the compiler. Wasn't that friction-free like a dynamic language?


### Under the hood

To get a little more insight into Reststop, point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/dev](http://localhost:8080/dev)

This Development Console shows you all the plugins, classes and source dirs that Reststop is currently tracking for you.


## Creating a new plugin

Go to root of your Reststop project and run:

        mvn reststop:create-plugin -Dname=api -Dpackage=org.company.helloworld.api

This automatically creates a new plugin, with maven module and Reststops configuration.


## Automatic recompile and hot-deploy

While writing code it is very convenient to have automatic recompile and hot-deploy. To experience this while developing, do the following:

        mvn clean install
        cd webapp
        mvn jetty:run.

### Add debugging

For a fully debugging enabled environment do the following:

        mvn clean install
        cd webapp
        mvnDebug jetty:run.

Then attach your debugger. Using this combination of automatic recompile, hot-deploy and debugging enables a
friction-free web development with the feedback loop of a dynamic language.

## Maven Goals

    reststop:create                 Creates Reststop project
    reststop:create-plugin          Creates Reststop plugin
    reststop:run                    Run application and open project and browser
    reststop:start                  Starts application
    reststop:stop                   Stops application
    reststop:package-plugins        Packages plugins and plugin configuration
    reststop:resolve-plugins        Resolves plugin configuration
    reststop:scan-plugins           Scan for plugins and create descriptor, export and import info
    reststop:dist                   Build Zip based distribution packages
    reststop:dist-rpm               Build RPM based distribution packages
