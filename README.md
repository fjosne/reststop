Reststop - friction-free web development
==============================================

## About

Reststop is a thin layer built on top of the Java Servlet API. Reststopâ€™s module system lets you code independent
features in individual modules. During development, Reststop will track your code base, recompile and hot-deploy the
modules which changed.

The result is friction-free web development with robustness of the Java language and tool stack, but with the feedback
loop of a dynamic language.


## Getting Started

Create project structure:

        mvn org.kantega.reststop:reststop-maven-plugin:create

Open a browser with the url:

        http://localhost:8080/helloworld/

Showing a page with the simple message:

        {"message":"Hello world"}

Now edit the return statement in plugins/helloworld/src/main/java/<YOUR PACKAGE NAME>/HelloworldResource.java to:

        return new Hello("New world");

Then just hit the reload button in the browser, and while you did that Reststop notified the change, recompiled and hot-deployed it showing:

        {"message":"New world"}

### Next Level

Try to change the word "world" into something different like, and the reload again:

        return new Hello("New order");

Reststop just discovered that a Test failed, showing test code and stack trace. Now update the HelloworldResourceTest and reload again.

Now try to remove the following line in HelloworldResource.java and reload:

        return new Hello("New world");

Reststop now shows where you have compilation error, with location and error message from compiler. Wasn't that friction-free like a dynamic language?


### Under the hood

To get a little more insight into Reststop, change the browser to:

        http://localhost:8080/dev

This Development Console shows you all the plugins, classes and source dirs that Reststop is currently tracking for you.


## Maven Goals

    reststop:create                 Creates simple project
    reststop:run                    Run application and open project and browser
    reststop:start                  Starts application
    reststop:stop                   Stops application
    reststop:package-plugins        Packages plugins and plugin configuration
    reststop:resolve-plugins        Resolves plugin configuration
    reststop:scan-plugins           Scan for plugins and create descriptor, export and import info
    reststop:dist                   Build Zip based distribution packages
    reststop:dist-rpm               Build RPM based distribution packages
